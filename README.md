Extracts UAssets then converts (parses) them into JSON. Built specifically for InventoryDataTables but extended for more types with time. Supporting all types is not planned and only files that I need will be parsed. You're free to fork this and add more types as you see fit, you'll mostly have to add the data to read_object_property and read_struct_property as the rest should never change, unless to add more atomic data types and `from_array`.

The root object type is determined by the file extension so each file needs its own Deserializer. Currently the extractor only works with `_b` files as many assumptions are present. Looking at the game's code we can find that most of the game's UAssets are simply UScripts, so they share 90% of their serialization process. But since they deal with different structs and objects, everything needs to be reversed manually, therefore I see no reason for me to deserialize things that don't matter to me.

The old version used [MK12PMan](https://github.com/thethiny/MK12PMan) to extract UAsset into objects. But now this functionality [exists here](/src/uasset).
